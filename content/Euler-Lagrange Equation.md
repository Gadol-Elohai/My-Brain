# The Euler-Lagrange Equation is the equation of motion arising from [[Lagrangian Mechanics]].

Its form is $$\frac{∂}{∂t} (\frac{∂}{∂v} ℒ) = \frac{∂}{∂x} ℒ$$

For example, for a particle with mass and velocity in a gravitational field, where the [[Lagrangian]] is 

$$ℒ = ½mv² - mgh$$
$$\frac{∂}{∂v} ℒ = mv$$
$$\frac{∂}{∂x} ℒ = -mg$$

it states:

$$\frac{∂}{∂t} (mv) = -mg$$

Or, the change in momentum over time (otherwise known as **acceleration**) is the (relatively constant) gravitational force. This is equivalent to Newton's 2nd Law. 

(Note: The cool thing above is that velocity and acceleration are vectors, and they can be vectors in 2- or 3-dimensions, so only the y-axis component would change over time).
