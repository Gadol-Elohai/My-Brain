# Euler-Lagrange Equation is the equation of motion arising from [Lagrangian Mechanics](LagrangianMechanics.md)

Its form is _∂/∂t (∂ℒ/∂v)= ∂ℒ/∂x_. 

For example, for a particle with mass and velocity in a gravitational field, where the [[Lagrangian]] *ℒ = ½mv² - mgh*

∂ℒ/∂v = mv
∂ℒ/∂x = -mg
it states:

∂/∂t (mv) = -mg
Or, the change in momentum over time (otherwise known as **acceleration**) is the (relatively constant) gravitational force. This is equivalent to Newton's 2nd Law. 

(Note: The cool thing above is that velocity and acceleration are vectors, and they can be vectors in 2- or 3-dimensions, so only the y-axis component would change over time).
