# Principle 7: [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] aims to be time-limited

Date: 2021-12-11

The goal of the therapist is to provide relief of the initial symptoms, to help with a remission (gradual reduction and even cure) of the disorder, and teach them skills to avoid relapse and deal with other major problems in their lives, as per [Principle 6](<CBT P6 - Own Teacher>). 

As remission occurs, therapy sessions become more spaced-out in time (say, from weekly to bi-weekly), and eventually, the patient may be let go completely, or have very occasional "booster sessions" every 3 or 6 months or even yearly.
