# Holiness is about devotion

Date: 2022-01-02

There is a common conception of "holiness" as "separation, exaltedness, moral perfection, purity". This comes from 1) insisting on translating the terms *qadosh* and *hagios* as "holiness", even though few people understand the term; and 2) W.W. Baudissin (1878) who proposed that *qadosh* comes from *qad* "to cut", as set apart. 

However, biblical context suggests that the meaning of "holy", as referring to God **and** people, is "totally devoted", which can be in conflict with the understanding of "separate".

My favorite example is in Isaiah 6:3, where the seraphim say (ESV):
> “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; 
> the whole earth is full of his glory!” 

Another example is Psalm 22, which begins
> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? 
> Why are you so far from saving me

But then, David says:
> Yet you are holy...
>  In you our fathers trusted; 
>     they trusted, and you delivered them. 
> To you they cried and were rescued; 
>  in you they trusted and were not put to shame. 

Why would David highlight God's purity in the context of God being with His people and rescuing?

Similarly, Psalm 71:22,24 says
> I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel . . . 24 And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt.

God's name (character) is describes as "holy" in many places, including Psalms 97:12, 103:1, 105:3, 106:47 and 111:9. In Exodus 34, the revelation of God's name, He says this:
> The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, 7 keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children, to the third and the fourth generation.”

If this is God's name, then it makes no sense to call it "holy" if it means purity, but makes perfect sense to call it "holy" if it means "completely devoted".

In Isaiah 5:15-16, God says that He shows himself "exalted in justice and holy in righteousness", which refers to social justice, or aiding the oppressed. Six other times in Isaiah, God's title of "Holy One of Israel" is tied to his role as *go'el* "redeemer" (41:14, 43:14, 47:4, 48:17, 49:7, 54:5). His total devotion to the people of Israel manifests itself in their return form exile.

Ezekiel 36:22 says Israel profaned God's name by going into exile, and God would act for the sake of His name by returning them. The profaning means that the nations were made to doubt God's holiness -- devotion to His people.

This is why the Holy Spirit is holy, because He is with His people: He teaches us (John 14:26), comforts us (Acts 9:31), intercedes for us (Rom. 8:26-27), empowers us to abound in hope (Rom 15.13), giving us life (Rom 8.11), bringing unbelievers to obedience (Rom 15.19), revealing deep and glorious things to us (1 Cor 2.10), washing, sanctifying, and justifying us (1 Cor 6.11), bearing all manner of beautiful fruit in our lives (Gal 5.22-23), sealing our security for the day of redemption (Eph 4.20), dwelling in us (2 Tim 1.14), and renewing us (Titus 3.5). 

The fruit of the Spirit is "love, joy, kindness, peace, patience, etc.", which is to show love and devotion and dedication to other people.

> A helpful tool for eliciting a proper translation would be to tell a story of a father (or a mother in some cultures) who was totally devoted to the wellbeing of his children, or of a husband who was totally devoted to the welfare of his wife. After choosing culturally appropriate examples of how the man went above and beyond the normal call of duty because of his devotion, ask, “What would you call this man? What was he like?” This would open up a potentially valuable discussion that may unveil the right word or phrase.
