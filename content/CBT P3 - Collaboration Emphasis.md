# Principle 3: [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] emphasizes collaboration between the patient and the therapist

Date: 2021-12-05

At first, the patient comes with their main concern and the therapist is active in suggesting a direction for the therapy session. Later, the therapist invites the patient into a more active role, encouraging them to decide which problems to talk about, suggest the [dysfunctions](<Dysfunctional Thoughts.md>) in their thought processes about the problem, and summarizing the important points, and even coming up with homework. This is done through collaborative decision-making, as the therapist or the patiens suggests a course and the other follows if they consider it appropriate. This also means that the patient can choose not to touch a particular topic or method at any given time.

This point is closely related to [Principle 6](<CBT P6 - Own Teacher>), teaching the patient to be their own therapist, as the patient is able to participate more actively as they understand the therapeutic process and the tools used.
