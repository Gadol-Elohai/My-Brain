# Principle 9: [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] teaches patients empirically to identify, evaluate, and respond to their [[Dysfunctional Thoughts]] and beliefs.

Date: 2021-12-11

[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] helps teachers identify their emotions and then thoughts, and to evaluate them as to whether they are appropriate and represent reality.

The teaching process happens empirically, through first the therapist questioning their [[Automatic Thoughts]] or conscious thoughts (which the patient learns to do) and behavioral experiments which test their predictions (ex.: "If I even look at a picture of a spider, I'll get so anxious I'll faint"). 

Challenging and questioning the thoughts is intense and [collaborative](<CBT P3 - Collaboration Emphasis>), not unilateral, and so requires [a very strong relationship between the therapist and the patient](<CBT P2 - Therapeutic Alliance>).
