# International Phonetics Alphabet (IPA)

The IPA is an alphabet meant to have symbols for all the sounds distinguished (called [[Phonemes]]) in all the languages in the world. It has two modalities: narrow transcription and broad transcription. 

Broad transcription is surrounded by forward-slashes // and basically only notates the phonemes as understood in the language's own system. 

Narrow transcription is surrounded by square brackets \[\], and is more specific. It has to notate as much detail as possible about the sounds, to serve as an accurate pronunciation guide to whoever is reading.
