# Mature Christianity is maximalist

While Jesus is with us forever even in our lowest points, He desires us and is gracious enough not to leave us forever in a state of just enough. Those born of Jesus want to know more, enjoy more of Jesus, and then believe more, hope more, and love more, instead of just scrapingby with the minimum.

Philippians 1:22-26 shows the maximalist attitude:
> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again (ESV). 

Paul knows that his personal preference isn't the final word all the time, and is willing to do more for Jesus in his last days.

There are 3 parts to this maximalism:
- Fruitful labor: Jesus is working and calls us -- and the Spirit empowers us -- to fruitful labor, including work, preaching, evangelism, worship, and creating. And fruitful work is *supernatural*, done by the Spirit's power, through our efforts. 
- Others' progress and joy: 
> He resolves to honor Christ through his ongoing life by giving himself to the progress and joy of others’ faith. Paul’s life, as long as he lives, is dedicated to the glory of Christ through advancing others’ joy in Christ. Paul is not scraping by. He is not groping for spiritual minimums. He is not focusing his planning on a single act or word or two. He means to abound in doing good (2 Corinthian 9:8). He hopes for his life to overflow in countless acts and words for the good of others. His impulse is not only maximalist but others-oriented.
- To give **ample** cause to glory in Christ: Paul wants his presence at Philippi to give the believers not a minimum of cause, but abundant cause to boast and rejoice in Christ, and in that way multiply His name.
