# Cognitive behavioral therapy reduces crime significantly

Date: 2021-11-19 

Crime seems to be caused in great part by [[System 1]] decision making -- fast and nearly instinctual thinking. [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] gives people the tools to slow down their thinking and assess whether their instinctual responses are appropriate to the situation -- more akin to [[System 2]] thinking, and this changed decision making has produced reductions in arrests and violent arrest of 28-35% and 45-50%, respectively, in intervened areas in Chicago. 

The study was done on high-school and college-level students, and school dropout rates were also reduced, not unrelated to crime.

The study cited below also suggests that these huge improvements can be relatively cheap, with cost ratios of 5-to-1 or up to 30-to-1 or more.
