# The Johnny Decimal System is a way to organize personal information and files.

Date: 2021-12-31

The Johnny Decimal System allows for the organization of all sorts of knowledge on an individual basis, by making sure that everything has one correct place to go. 

It can be summarized in the following acronym: AC.ID, where AC stands for **Area Category** and ID stands for **identification.**

The first step is to divide up the knowledge or files into up to 9 clear categories, which will be represented by the numbers 10, 20, 30... 90. An example would be: *images* (10), *personal files* (20), *hobbies* (30), *work* (40). 

In the case that we're organizing files, we would then create folders for each of the categories.

Then, within each category, we create further divisions. For example, images could be divided into: *images of myself* (11), *images of my family* (12). We would also create folders for these. 

Finally, we can create many folders inside these, starting from .01 and working our way up to .99, to create the final identifications.

The final structure could look like this:
- 10-19 Images
	- 11 Images of myself
		- 11.01 Graduation
		- 11.02 First diplomatic mission
	- 12 Images of my family
		- 12.01 Family retreat summer 2021
- 20-29 Personal files
	- 21 Legal documents
- 30-39 Hobbies
	- 31 Music
		- 31.01 Bass sheet music
		- 31.02 Recorder sheet music
		- 31.03 Video game sheet music
	- 32 Conlanging
		- 32.01 Middle Leni
		- 32.02 Riktayn
		- 32.03 Raunic
- 40-49 Work
	- 41 Ministry of Foreign Affairs
		- 41.01 SICA own documents 2021
		- 41.02 SICA received 2021
