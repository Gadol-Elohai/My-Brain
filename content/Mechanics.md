# Mechanics is the branch of [[Physics]] that relates to motion
## Types of mechanics
* [Classical (Newtonian) Mechanics](ClassicalMechanics.md)(models movement through each step in time using forces.
** [[Electromagnetism]]
* [Lagrangian Mechanics models the entire path of a particle](Lagrangian Mechanics.md) based on its energies and the ["Action"](Action%20Physics.md).
* [Hamiltonian Mechanics](Hamiltonian Mechanics.md)
* [Quantum Mechanics](Quantum Mechanics.md)
