### Investment treaties

#### Umbrella clauses

Umbrella clauses are clauses included in bilateral investment treaties (BIDs) whereby, if one of the signing countries fails in their obligations to a company or individual investing in that country, it would be counted as a violation of the treaty, and not just a violation of the contract.
