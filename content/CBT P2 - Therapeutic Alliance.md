Perhaps more than other forms of therapy, [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] requires there to be a strong relationship of trust between the therapist and the patient. 

The therapist can do this by showing warmth, empathy, caring, genuine regard, competence. The regard can be shown by making empathetic statements, listening closely and accurately summarizing their thoughts and feelings; pointing out small and large successes and maintinging an upbeat outlook. 

Also really importantly, the therapist must elicit feedback frmo the patient.
