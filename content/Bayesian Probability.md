# Probabilities are expectations of the event being true in Bayesian Probability.

Date: 2021-10-31 

[The physical reality of a probability is up to interpretation](<Probability Interpretation.md>), and one of the most common interpretations is Bayesian Probability. In Bayesian Probability, the probability represents our expectation that a given event should happen, or our expectation that the event is true. 

The most common competing view is [[Frequentist Probability]], which says that probability is the number of times an event happened over a many experiments.

Unlike Frequentist Probability, Bayesian Probability extends beyond physical events and lets us quantify and update our subjective conviction that something is true.

Bayesian probability uses [Bayes's Theorem](<Bayes Theorem.md>) to help us adjust our expectations based on new data. 

## Example
Imagine there are 3 boxes, and there is a ball put under one of them, but we don't know which. It could be random, so we have a  ⅓ expectation it's under any given box. If we check under one of the boxes and don't find it, we know have a ½ expectation that it's under one of the other two boxes.

I use the word **expecation** because the ball is in reality under one of the boxes, we just don't know which one.
