# Action is a measure of the change in relative energies over a path.

Date: 2021-10-27 

The Action is a scalar with dimensions Energy x Time or momentum x length, which measures the changes in Potential and Kinetic energy over a path.

Specifically, it is the integral of the [Lagrangian (a measure of the relative strengths of potential and kinetic energies)](Lagrangian.md) at every point in space and time over a path, between two time periods. 

$$S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} â„’ \,dt$$

Action is used in [Lagrangian Mechanics](LagrangianMechanics.md) and [Quantum Mechanics](QuantumMechanics.md) to model the path a particle will take, through the principle of stationary or least action.

## Principle of stationary (/ least) action
The principle of stationary action states that the path a particle travels is the one that minimizes the change in action at every small step in the path.
