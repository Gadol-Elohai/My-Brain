# Highlight to process later
Highlighting information in a text doesn't make it immediately go into your brain. Instead, use highlighting in a text to guide how you might process the information to learn it later. 

One model divides by color:
* Blue: Prerrequisite or previous knowledge or works
* Green: Assumptions, questions the text seeks to answer, goals of the text, and problems the text faces 
* Purple: Results, findings, and conclusions
* Red: Methodology, experiment design, math formulas or models 
* Yellow: Useful or outstanding points, examples, or facts
