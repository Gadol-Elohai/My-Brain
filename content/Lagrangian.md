# The Lagrangian is one measure of energy of a particle.

The Lagrangian is one measure of the energy of a particle with a certain position and speed at every point in space. It is defined as _L(x(t),v(t),t) = Ek - Ep_. It really can take either two values or two functions (of time) as its input.

The Lagrangian is used in [Lagrangian Mechanics, which tells you the whole path that a particle follows](LagrangianMechanics.md) to calculate the [Action, which is a measure of the change of energies in a particle as it goes through a path](Action%20Physics.md).
