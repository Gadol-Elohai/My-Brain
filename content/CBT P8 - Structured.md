# Principle 8: [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] sessions are structured

Date: 2021-12-11

[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] sessions follow a structure that facilitates the goals expressed in the other principles and helps the patient feel safe, knowing what to expect every time they go in. It also helps them do self-therapy after they are let go ([Principle 7](<CBT P7 - Time-Limited>))

The structure is in three stages:
- **Introductory part:** Includes checking the current mood of the patient, a review of the week's events, and setting the agenda for the current session -- namely, what problem, topic or technique the session will focus on. 
- **Middle part:** Reviewing the last homework (and hearing feedback about it), discussing the problems or topics on the agenda, assigning new homework, and summarizing what was learned this session.
- **Final part:** Asking for feedback about the current session. This is important as, following [Principle 2](<CBT P2 - Therapeutic Alliance>), it is extremely important to make the patient feel heard and important for the therapist.
