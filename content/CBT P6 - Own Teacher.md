# Principle 6: [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] aims to teach the patient to be their own therapist

Date: 2021-12-11

From the very first session, the therapist teaches the patient about the [[Cognitive Model]], relating it to the identified disorder (if any), and how [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] works. The therapist helps the patient directly identify and evaluate their thoughts and beliefs and strategies to change their behavior, but also how to do so, especially making sure that (if the patient wants) they take home notes on what they learned in the session and encourage them to review them.
