# Principle 4: [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] emphasizes problem-solving and is goal-oriented.

Date: 2021-12-11

[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is problem-focused: The treatment is structured around concrete problems that the patient identifies (ex.: "I am alone" or "I have great anxiety in social situations"). 

CBT is also goal-oriented: The therapist helps the patient set measureable goals in behavioral terms for their own recovery and performance -- based on their expressed problems --, follows their progress in getting to the goal (celebrating their successes), and gives them the tools to get there.
