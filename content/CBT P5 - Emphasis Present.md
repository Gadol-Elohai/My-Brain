# Principle 5: [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] initially emphasizes the present.

Date: 2021-12-11

(Unlike i.e. psychoanalysis) the therapist focuses treament on present problems, identifying thoughts as per the [[Cognitive Model]], and taking steps to get better, as the patient is more able to explore other parts of their psyche as they experience betterment from their current symptoms. 

Treatment shifts to the past when the patient greatly desires to do so; or when the patient is "stuck" in dysfunctional thinking or beliefs, and exploring the childhood or past origins of the thoughts or beliefs would help change their rigid system.

This exploration of the past is used to [formulate the beliefs the patient may have in cognitive terms](<CBT P1 - Formulation Cognitive Terms>), in order to evaluate their validity both in the past and in the present. Thus, [[Dysfunctional Thoughts]] can be replaced.
