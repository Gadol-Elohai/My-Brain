# Noether's theorem means that the conservation laws arise from symmetries in the equations of Physics.

Noether's theorem, made by Emily Noether in (year), states that the conservations laws (such as conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, conservation of angular momentum, conservation of charge, etc.) arise from (global) [symmetries](Symmetry%20Physics.md) in the equations of Physics.

Specifically, it says that a conservation law and a symmetry in the equations are in fact equivalent. Here are a few of the correspondences:
* Symmetry in time <-> conservation of energy
* Translation symmetry <-> conservation of momentum
* Rotational symmetry <-> conservation of angular momentum

For example, if the [[Lagrangian]] is translationally symmetric in a system:
ℒ(x,v,t)=ℒ(x+1,v,t)
Then, according to the [[Euler-Lagrange Equation]]:
∂/∂t (½mv²)= ∂ℒ/∂x
∂ℒ/∂x = 0

∴ ∂/∂t (mv) = 0
Otherwise read as: momentum is conserved.
