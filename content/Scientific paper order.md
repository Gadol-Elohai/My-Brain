# Read scientific papers for main ideas

The way to read a paper varies significantly based on what your goals are. For most purposes, a good order to write papers in is:

1. **Abstract / summary:** This might give the general gist of the paper. There might be unfamiliar terms which may be explained in the paper. If interested, keep going. Otherwise, stop.
1. **Discussion / conclusions & introduction:** These contain the main points of the text, and can tell you if the paper is what you're looking for. This may be what you need if you're just looking for a cursory overview or results.
	* Think: What does the paper demonstrate? How would I get to those results if I tried to do it? It will help you understand the authors' train of thought. 
1. **Skim through the body:** Read only the titles at first, to familiarize yourself with the text and get a structure in your head. After, start reading the results of each section, then the explanations and any interesting figures you find.
1. Only if you need to go so in-depth, study the methodology or experiment design.
