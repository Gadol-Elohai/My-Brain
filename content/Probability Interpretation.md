# The physical reality of probability can be interpreted in multiple ways.

Date: 2021-10-31 

Mathematical probabilities help make predictions, but it is not unambiguous what the numbers represent. They could be a measure of the actual tendency of things to happen in the physical world, or they could be a measure of how strongly one believes an event will occur. The two main families of interpretations are:

* Physical interpretations, such as Frequentist Probability, which say that probabilities represent the actual tendency of events to happen in a physical world with random events. Such a tendency can be measured by experiments. 
* Evidential interpretations, such as [Bayesian Probability](Bayesian%20Probability.md), which state that the probabilities represent the strength of our conviction that an event will occur. 

These ideas are not mutually exclusive.
