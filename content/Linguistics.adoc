= Linguistics

Here is my knowledge related to linguistics, I suppose.

== Etymology

== Typology

=== Synthesis vs Analysis

== Phonology

* It is the study of how sounds work in a language.
* *Phonemes* are sounds that a language distinguishes. For example, Mandarin doesn't distinguish [b] and [p], so they are not separate phonemes in Mandarin, but they are in English.

== Phonetics

=== International Phonetics Alphabet (IPA)

The IPA is an alphabet meant to have symbols for all the sounds distinguished in all the languages in the world. It has two modalities: narrow transcription and broad transcription. Broad transcription is surrounded by forward-slashes // and basically only notates the phonemes in the language. Narrow transcription is surrounded by square brackets [], and is more specific. It has to notate as much detail as possible about the sounds, especially in relation to other sounds.
