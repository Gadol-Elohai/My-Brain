> This wretched INN, where we scarce stay to bait, 
> We call our DWELLING-PLACE:
> We call one STEP A RACE:
> But angels in their full enlightened state,
> Angels, who LIVE, and know what â€™tis to BE,
> Who all the nonsense of our language see,
> Who speak THINGS, and our WORDS,their ill-drawn PICTURES, scorn,
> When we, by a foolish figure, say,
> BEHOLD AN OLD MAN DEAD! then they
> Speak properly, and cry, BEHOLD A MAN-CHILD BORN!

Abraham Cowley.
