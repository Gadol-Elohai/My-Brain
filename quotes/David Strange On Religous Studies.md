> Much religious studies has presupposed an alleged ‘neutral’ and ‘objective’ scientific positivism which does not comport well with the theological task, and, in fact, can be shown to be as ideological or crypto-theological as any explicit ‘confessional’ approach to the study of religion.[32](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/coming-to-our-senses-the-case-for-a-civil-elenctics-and-an-elenctic-civility/#_ftn32) Unashamedly, the conservative Catholic D’Costa argues that contra modernity’s construal of the academic study of ‘religion,’ the fullest understanding and interpreting of the religions are seen ‘in the light of the triune God who is the fullness of truth. Only from this theological narrative can other religions be truly understood, simply because Christianity is true.’[33](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/coming-to-our-senses-the-case-for-a-civil-elenctics-and-an-elenctic-civility/#_ftn33)
