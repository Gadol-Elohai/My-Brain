> _Elenctics_ receives the greatest support from its repeated awareness that the sharpest weapons must in the first place be turned against ourselves.â€¦ Anyone who knows himself to any extent knows the finesse with which a man can escape from God, and wrestle free from his grasp. To be really able to convict anyone in sin, a person must know himself, and the hidden corners of his heart very well. There is no more humbling work in the world that to engage in _elenctics_. For at each moment the person knows that the weapons which he turns against another have wounded himself. The Holy Spirit convicts us, and then through us he convicts the world.
