> The letter kills, it always kills, unless the Spirit gives life. If the Holy Spirit moves, if the Holy Spirit takes away the deadlyÂ blindness of the human heart and rings the letter of Shakespeare and the letter of the coronavirus into their true relationship with ultimate reality for the glory of Christ, and the work of salvation, and obedience of faith, and the ultimate purposes of God in history, then even Shakespeare or a shattering disease become a prism, a worship producing prism through which the glory of God shines innately.
