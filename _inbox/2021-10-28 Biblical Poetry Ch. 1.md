Title: The Art of Biblical Narrative Ch. 1: The Dynamics of Parallelism
Author: Robert Alter

Different models for the basis of Biblical Poetry have been proposed: parallelism, sound and syllables, and syntax. Some things are irrecoverable: the actual original sound of the poetry. We also don't always have the nuances of the original phrases. Finally, we don't know what the original line breaks were, and it's not even always clear where prose ends and poetry begins.

The first example is Lamech's speech to his wives in Gen. 4:23-24. He first argues that it is a poem (citing Barbara Smith), because it has a sustained rhythm, with a formal structure, therefore we experience it as poetry.

The formal structure is parallelism:
* Parallelism of meaning: Ada & Zilla / wives of Lamech; hear / give ear; my voice / my speech
* Parallelism of syntax: Word order is the same (in this case, identical); in the third line, the syntax is inverted instead (maybe to give closure to the poem)
* Parallelism of sound: Stresses are similar between parallel versets (line-halves or line-thirds of a poetic line)
* (Another type of parallelism he doesn't cite is Lexical parallelism (where the same words or roots are used) and morphological parallelism (where the words, even different words, have the same grammatical form or construction))

Alter argues that Biblical poetry is not "thought rhymes" as in the **same** idea is restated, but that movement comes from the parallelism: namely, the differences in the parallelism are highlighted, and the versets reinforce each other. Ex.: Numbers are used not literally, but as a "how much more so" strategy.

In many pairs, the poetry seems to move from a more common term (i.e. *qol* "voice") to a more literary term (i.e. *imrah* "speech/utterance"), or sometimes backwards. This can mean a slight development of meaning between the verses (Psa. 88:12-13 steadfast care / constancy; gave / perdition; wonders / bounty; darkness / oblivion)
