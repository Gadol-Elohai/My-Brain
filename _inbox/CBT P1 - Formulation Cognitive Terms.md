# [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] formulates patients' problems in terms of thoughts

Date: 2021-12-05

The approach is to try to catch and understand the thoughts that lead to feelings and behaviors. By understanding those thoughts as thoughts, it allows for a more distanced analysis that can replace [[Dysfunctional Thoughts]] with helpful, useful, realistic, or [adaptive](Adaptive%20Thoughts.md) ones. This is based on the [[Cognitive Model]], whereby thoughts, even [[Automatic Thoughts]], influence emotions, which leads to behaviors. 

The author cited uses three time-frames to explore:
- Current thinking that contributes to feelings ("I'm a failure" -> depression) and problematic behavior (ex.: not giving most new things a try); [CBT initially emphasizes the present](CBT%20P5%20-%20Emphasis%20Present.md).
- Precipitating factors at the onset of symptoms (ex.: being away from home for the first time, a grandparent's death). 
- Developmental events and key patterns of interpreting current events (ex.: "Successes are luck, but weaknesses are my true self" or "I must help everyone at my best capacity all the time").
