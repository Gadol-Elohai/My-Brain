# "Write what you know" refers to associating the circumstances your characters are going through with your life experience

The writing advice "write what you know" means writing must be similar to acting. You may not have lived through the exact circumstances that your characters are going through, but you can extrapolate what similar experiences have been like to live through and impose that on how your characters act and react.

The great example from the source is that she doesn't know what being splashed with acid is like, but she does know what having something fall on you and realizing you have to remove it as fast as possible is like (such as a spider).
